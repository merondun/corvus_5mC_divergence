# 5mC processing

Scripts and plots going from raw fastq to cov.gz to DSS DMPs and finally to merged and classified genome-wide txt files. Large files (cov.gz) and DSS files found at the zenodo repo. 

## `pre_processing_bismark`

Contains scripts for the initial processing of bisulfite sequencing data using Bismark.

## `DMP_calling`

This directory holds the scripts related to the calling of DMPs 

## `consensus_classification`

Stores the outputs from the consensus classification step, which involves integrating multiple methylation data types to classify regions based on consensus methylation patterns across experiments. 

## `plotting_files` 

PNGs, PDFs, and input files for the smaller plots.
